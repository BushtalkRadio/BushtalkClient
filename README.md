## Features

* Thousands of new POIs each with an audio tour that is automatically played on arrival
* Submit your own POIs and audio tours, just write the script and we generate the audio!
* Help us map the world by exploring new areas and finding undiscovered POIs using your Bush Radar
* Tune in to local radio or watch videos relevant to your current location!

## What is it?

Bushtalk Radio is a community driven project with the aim to fill the vast world of MSFS with thousands of interesting landmarks and POIs. Each landmark will have an audio tour that will automatically play as you approach it. We have audio tours for all in-game POIs (including World Updates for Japan, USA, UK & Belenux) as well as thousands of community submitted content with more being added every day: mountains, skycrapers, volcanoes, historical battles or a random bit of local trivia - there's something for everyone.

Users can submit new locations or discover it using your Bush Radar. Once you find a location to submit, just write an interesting, witty script and we'll create the audio tour for you. Not the creative type? Autogenerate one with our Wikipedia Import tool, we won't judge you. We want to introduce players to amazing locations around the world. Add them as part of your next bush trip or fly aimlessly and stumble into something special.

There are 3 components to Bushtalk Radio:

* **[Bushtalk Radio website](https://www.bushtalkradio.com)** - This is where our users upload landmarks and POIs. Once you connect, the audio will be played through the browser so make sure to keep this open.

* **[Bushtalk client](https://flightsim.to/file/7898/bushtalk-radio-client-audio-tours-from-your-cockpit)** - The client is needed to upload your airplane location to our server. This is what allows us to automatically play the audio tour based on your in-game location. Drag and drop the folder into your Community folder. Once in the cockpit, press "TAB" to bring up the MSFS toolbar and log in with your account

* **[Bushtalk Radio Landmarks Pack](https://flightsim.to/file/7285/bushtalk-radio-world-landmarks-pack)** (OPTIONAL) - This optional addon allows you to see all of the community POI markers in-game and LittleNavMap. This file will be **updated monthly** to include all of the landmarks and POIs submitted on the Bushtalk Radio website so if your submissions are mission then wait for next month's update

## How to use

While you can still use the website on mobile to track your flight, we recommend using the computer you'll be playing MSFS2020 on as the browser needs to be open for the audio tours to be played.

1. Make an account at https://www.bushtalkradio.com and log in
2. Download the [Bushtalk World Landmarks Pack](https://flightsim.to/file/7285/bushtalk-radio-world-landmarks-pack) and install it to your community folder
3. Download the [Bushtalk Radio Client](https://flightsim.to/file/7898/bushtalk-radio-client-audio-tours-from-your-cockpit) and log in
4. Choose a suitable departure airport to the landmark you wish to explore. (TIP: our website will tell you the nearest airport if you click on the POI)
5. If you've logged in with the client, you will see your plane being tracked on the website
6. Fly towards your destination, if you installed the Landmarks Pack then you'll see the POI marker in-game and as you approach the audio tour will play automatically.
7. **Remember that you need to logged in with the client AND the website, otherwise the audio will not play!**
8. Read the FAQ below if you have any issues

## NEW IN 1.3: Exploring new places with Bush Radar

Bushtalk Radio has thousands of POIs added by players but there has always been one limitation. You can only submit audio tours about places you know. We want to encourage you to explore new locations and make new discoveries to publish with Bushtalk Radio.

Bush Radar is an exploration tool that allows you to find undiscovered POIs while out in the bush. New discoveries can be found on the map as green blips which will also be added to your Discovery Log. Once you've found something worth sharing, publish it to Bushtalk Radio along with an audio tour. To get started simply turn the radar on from the Discovery Log page. On your next trip, keep an eye out for new Discoveries. Once your Bush Radar is on, it will automatically scan as soon as it's ready. There are 3 attributes to your Bush Radar that you should keep in mind:

1. **Range** - The range is maximum distance in kilometers that you're able to scan. This is given as the radius of the scanning area
2. **Cooldown** - The amount of time between each scan. Bush planes are perfect for ensuring you have optimal coverage between each scan. Keep an eye on your scan history as you fly (faint grey circle) and adjust your speed accordlingly
3. **Scan limit** - The maximum number of retrievable discoveries in each scan. You are more likely to hit the limit when flying in dense urban areas

Publishing new Discoveries can done from the map as you fly, or at the end of a long trip from the Discovery Log. Keep in mind that not all Discoveries are worth publishing, but this is up to you to decide. Open your Discovery in Wikipedia and see what interesting tidbits of information you can find. Did you find the site of a decisive battle or is it just another high school in the suburbs?

Stay tuned as we'll be adding different Discovery types and collectables around the world for you to find.

## FAQ

### The audio tours are not playing automatically

Make sure you're connected with the Bushtalk Radio client <b>AND></b> logged in our website. Do not minimize the browser window. Some browsers do not support audio being autoplayed without user input. For the best experience try using Chrome.

### I have a feature request or bug to report

Best and quickest place would be on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZcGgw9mUqA), but you can also email me at admin@bushtalkradio.com or through the feedback form on our webite via the '+' button.

### I'm having issues with the new cockpit client and/or I prefer the external client

Our old external client is still [available to download here](https://bushtalkradioclient-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/BushtalkExternalClient.zip). This is a python script packaged into a executable so your browser/windows might flag it as a virus but rest assured this is a false positive.
