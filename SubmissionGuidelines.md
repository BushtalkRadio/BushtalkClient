# Submission Guidelines

Generating audio from user scripts make up a large part of our server costs. To help keep these costs down and provide the best experience for fellow listeners, we ask that you follow certain guidelines:

• Audio tours should be **in English** and with proper punctuation. Use commas sparingly as the generator tends to over exaggerate the pauses.

• Always proof read your script before submitting, especially Wikipedia imports as they tend to contain bad punctuation, repetitive statements and overly technical language.

• Ensure coordinates are placed correctly and centered so our in-game POIs will appear correctly. Volcanoes should be centered and river markers should be over water.

• Select an appropriate autoplay distance to make sure it doesn't clash with other landmarks. Only use 10km for exceptionally large landmarks such as mountains and large lakes

• Submit tangible landmarks rather than regions. Avoid states, counties, countries, etc

• If you spot bad audio while out in the bush, please flag the landmark so we can improve them. Please rate good submissions to let authors know you enjoyed them!

• Avoid secondary information inside brackets, especially translations, acronymns or unit conversions as these tend to break up the flow of the audio. Example:
