# Submission Guidelines

Generating audio from user scripts make up a large part of our server costs. To help keep these costs down and provide the best experience for fellow listeners, we ask that you follow certain rules and guidelines. Try not to blindly rely on the Wikipedia import tool, the imported script can always be improved. We've added that feature to give you a good starting point.

What should you submit? A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself what you found interesting about the POI you're about to submit. A lot of Wikipedia articles will be about mundane things which won't necessarily be interesting to a fellow listener.

## Rules

• **Always proof read** your script before submission.
• Audio tours should be **in English** and with proper punctuation, making sure there's always a space after the fullstop or comma.
• Submit tangible POIs rather than regions. Avoid states, counties, countries, etc
• If the imported article includes a list, please remove it as it does not work well in audio format.
• Do not include unnecessarily large numbers or co-ordinates in the script

## Guidelines

• Ensure coordinates are placed correctly and centered so our in-game POIs will appear correctly. Volcanoes should be centered and river markers should be over water.

• Select an appropriate autoplay distance to make sure it doesn't clash with other landmarks. Only use 10km for exceptionally large landmarks such as mountains and large lakes

• If you spot bad audio while out in the bush, please flag the landmark so we can improve them. Please rate good submissions to let authors know you enjoyed them!

• Avoid secondary information inside brackets, especially translations, acronymns or unit conversions as these tend to break up the flow of the audio.

• Use commas sparingly as the generator tends to over exaggerate the pauses.
